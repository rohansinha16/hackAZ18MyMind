# My Mind Alexa Skill

This Alexa skill is designed to help monitor and track mental health by giving users the option to take four different clinician approved surveys. These surveys use differently weighted questions to help identify any potential mental health issues. The results are stored 100% anonymously for each user which will allow them to go back and keep track of their mental health history and potentially identify problems. 

If you are ever confused on how to respond to the skill day 'help' at any time to get instructions on how to continue.

*** DISCLAIMER: This skill is simply a tool that can be used to help put you in the right direction, do not treat the results given as an actual medical diagnosis. If you have thoughts of suicide, self harm, or any other potentially dangerous thoughts please contact a medical professional***
